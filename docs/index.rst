Welcome to zoomies' documentation!
===================================

Stars get the zoomies too. **zoomies** is a kinematic age prediction package that uses Gaia parallax, proper motion, and radial velocity along with a Milky Way potential model to produce a stellar age prediction based on its galactic orbit.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
