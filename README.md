# zoomies

Stars get the zoomies too. This is a kinematic age prediction package that uses Gaia parallax, proper motion, and radial velocity along with a Milky Way potential model to produce a stellar age prediction based on its galactic orbit.

To install: 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ssagear/zoomies
```
